Inspired by [vscode rich presence][2]

![screenshot of the plugin on Discord][3]
# Installation

- Put `rpc.com`, `init.lua` and `rpc.lua` in a folder called `lite-xl-discord`

### Compiling from scratch

`rpc.com` is compiled with [αcτµαlly pδrταblε εxεcµταblε][4] and [cosmopolitan][5]. 

You'll need to download the [cosmopolitan amalgamation][6] (cosmopolitan.zip) and extract it to this directory.
After that, just run `build.sh`.
